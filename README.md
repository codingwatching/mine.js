## [A BETTER MINEJS](https://github.com/voxelize/voxelize)

MineJS has been rewritten into a customizable fullstack library called [voxelize](https://github.com/voxelize/voxelize)

# [MineJS](http://mine.shaoruu.io/)

MineJS is a multiplayer voxel engine that runs in your browser! (Probably should change the name to MineRS/MineTS)


**Any PRs are welcomed!** 
Here's the quick TODO list that we're following: [Link](https://www.notion.so/f61d8c4ce1e245b6aba980adf0f1ea7c?v=77f64c4f1ed342a1b25d8af524cb9da0)

## :dart: Disclaimers

This is purely a passionate project. Although inspired, I have no intention for this game to be affiliated with Minecraft, or any licensed voxel engines. Further, textures and assets used in the game are all licensed for free use. More information can be found in the last section.

## :crown: Motivation

We thought it would be interesting to design a game that is inspired by popular voxel engines such as "Minetest" and "Veloren". With the combination of Rust and TypeScript, we hope to deliver quality graphics and performance, as well as interactive multiplayer game play within a 3D voxel-based environment.
